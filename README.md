# Author's Website - Project README

This repository contains the code for an Author's website, built using Next.js for the frontend, Node.js Express for the backend, and MongoDB as the database. The website serves as a platform for the author to showcase their blogs, provide contact information, and manage an online store where users can purchase their books.

## Features

- Blogs: The website offers a section for the author to publish and manage their blogs. Users can read and comment on the blog posts.

- Contact: Users can find contact information for the author, enabling them to reach out for inquiries or collaboration opportunities.

- About: This section provides a brief introduction to the author, their background, and achievements.

- Ecommerce Store: The website includes an ecommerce implementation, allowing users to browse and purchase the author's books.

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: The frontend of the website is built using Next.js, a popular React framework that offers server-side rendering, static site generation, and other performance optimizations.

- Backend: The backend is developed using Node.js Express, providing robust API endpoints to interact with the database and handle user requests.

- Database: MongoDB is used as the database to store and manage data related to blogs, store products, and user interactions.
